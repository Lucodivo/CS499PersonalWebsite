        <h3>Do people really ask you enough questions to warrant an FAQ?</h3>
        <p>No.</p>
        <h3>Why "In A Sweater Poorly Knit"?</h3>
        <p>I wanted a more interesting website name and it's the name of a beautiful song by mewithoutYou</p>
        <h3>Why are you yelling??</h3>
        <p>It's just the code pro font. I'm sorry.</p>
        <h3>Who made this terrible website?</h3>
        <p>I did. If you can easily read this, it has surpassed my wildest expectations.</p>
        <h3>Do you like long walks on the beach?</h3>
        <p>Not as much as I like an equivalent sum of several short walks on the beach.</p>
        <h3>Are you ever sarcastic?</h3>
        <p>No.</p>
        <h3>Why are there links to your private social media accounts?</h3>
        <p>Think of it like you're being invited to a party. You're attendance would be great, but you still have to knock.</p>
        <h3>How'd Houdini die?</h3>
        <p>A human by the name J. Gordon Whitehead asked Houdini "whether it was true that punches in the stomach
            did not hurt him." Whitehead suddenly proceeded to strike Houdini (who was reclined on a couch
            with a broken ankle) with four "hammer-like blows below the belt" until Houdini could gesture that he could
            take no more and that he did not expect Whitehead to so readily strike him. Houdini died shortly after as the
            result of appendicitis. His last words were: "I'm tired of fighting."</p>
        <h3>Dude.</h3>
        <p>I know.</p>
